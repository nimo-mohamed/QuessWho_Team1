# Quess Who ðŸ”Ž - Mini Project

## Introduction
"Quess Who?" is a classic deduction game where players ask yes-or-no questions to eliminate characters and identify the opponentâ€™s character. This project implements the backend logic for the game in **Scala**.

## Features
- **Random Character Selection**: Each player is assigned a secret character.
- **Question-based Deduction**: Players can ask predefined questions about their opponentâ€™s character traits.
- **Hints System**: Players can use hints to get clues about the hidden character.
- **Two-Player Turn-Based Logic**: Players take turns asking questions and guessing characters.

## How It Works
1. At the start of the game, each player is assigned a random character.
2. Players take turns asking questions about the opponentâ€™s character (e.g., "Does the character have glasses?").
3. Based on the answers, players eliminate characters.
4. Players can use hints to narrow down the options.
5. The game continues until a player correctly guesses the opponentâ€™s character.

## Game Flow
1. Players are assigned a random character.
2. Player 1 starts the game by choosing one of three options:
    - they can guess the character,
    - they can choose from a series of questions about the characters attributes,
    - or they can ask for a hint.
3. Player 2 takes their turn using the options above.
4. Players can attempt to guess the opponentâ€™s character at any time.
5. The first player to correctly guess the character wins.

## Future Enhancements
- Recursion 
- Implement further multiplayer functionality.
- Add more characters and more traits. 
- Add a frontend for a graphical interface.
