# Quess Who ðŸ”Ž - Mini Project

## Introduction
"Guess Who?" is a classic deduction game where players ask yes-or-no questions to eliminate characters and identify the opponentâ€™s character. This project implements the backend logic for the game in **Scala**.

## Features
- **Random Character Selection**: Each player is assigned a secret character.
- **Question-based Deduction**: Players can ask predefined questions about their opponentâ€™s character traits.
- **Hints System**: Players can use hints to get clues about the hidden character.
- **Two-Player Turn-Based Logic**: Players take turns asking questions and guessing characters.

## How It Works
1. At the start of the game, each player is assigned a random character.
2. Players take turns asking questions about the opponentâ€™s character (e.g., "Does the character have glasses?").
3. Based on the answers, players eliminate characters.
4. Players can use hints to narrow down the options.
5. The game continues until a player correctly guesses the opponentâ€™s character.

## Installation & Running the Game
### Prerequisites

## Game Flow
1. Players are assigned a random character.
2. Player 1 starts by asking a yes-or-no question.
3. Player 2 responds, and Player 1 eliminates characters based on the response.
4. Player 2 takes their turn.
5. Players can use hints to get additional clues.
6. Players can attempt to guess the opponentâ€™s character at any time.
7. The first player to correctly guess the character wins.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a frontend for a graphical interface.
- Implement networked multiplayer functionality.
- Improve AI-based questioning logic.
